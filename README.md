# Traffic Light Violation Detection

## Description

This project aims to detect traffic light violations, specifically the running of red lights, using video footage. It utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for real-time object detection.

## Features

- Real-time detection of traffic lights.
- Detection of vehicles running red lights.
- Uses YOLO object detection models for accurate predictions: The data_images was trained and validated with the yolov8s model(Use of google colab was done for the training.) and the weights are used to detect the video
